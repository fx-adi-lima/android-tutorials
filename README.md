# purpose
It help me understand android programming better, just hope sharing it here will do the same for others
Simple hello world program, which has been written completely from scratch, with no XML layout files,
and build using nothing more than a Makefile, or even a shell script, from inside android itself, I guess will
lift-up our spirits as newbies.

Always use simple way to do things, if it helps me understand, I'm sure will help others too.
